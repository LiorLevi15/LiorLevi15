# Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹


My name is Lior, and I'm excited to introduce myself as a software engineer currently in my final semester at BGU University, pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

My passion for coding and software development has driven me towards constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible and coming up with innovative solutions to everyday problems. I believe in leveraging technology to create a positive impact in the world, and I'm committed to using my skills to drive change.
